    <p><h3 style="color: brown;">Technology :- </h3>is the application of knowledge for achieving practical goals in a reproducible way.
        [1] The word technology can also mean the products resulting from such efforts,
        [2]: 117 [3] including both tangible tools such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones such as software. 
        Technology plays a critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life.

        Technological advancements have led to significant changes in society. 
        The earliest known technology is the stone tool, used during prehistoric times, 
        followed by the control of fire, which contributed to the growth of the human brain and the development of language during the Ice Age. 
        The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age allowed greater travel and the creation of more complex machines. 
        More recent technological inventions, including the printing press, telephone, and the Internet, have lowered barriers to communication 
        and ushered in the knowledge economy.

        While technology contributes to economic development and improve human prosperity, it can also have negative impacts like pollution 
        or resource depletion, or may cause social harms like technological unemployment resulting from automation. As a result, 
        there are ongoing philosophical and political debates about the role and use of technology, the ethics of technology, 
        and ways to mitigate potential downsides.</p>

            Tools were initially developed by hominids through observation and trial and error.
            Around 2 Mya (million years ago), they learned to make the first stone tools by hammering flakes off a pebble, 
            forming a sharp hand axe.This practice was refined 75 kya (thousand years ago) into pressure flaking, enabling much finer work.

            The discovery of fire was described by Charles Darwin as "possibly the greatest ever made by man".
            Archeological, dietary, and social evidence point to "continuous [human] fire-use" at least 1.5 Mya.
            Fire, fueled with wood and charcoal, allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility, 
            improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten.The cooking hypothesis 
            proposes that the ability to cook promoted an increase in hominid brain size, though some researchers find the evidence inconclusive.
            Archeological evidence of hearths was dated to 790 kya; researchers believe this is likely to have intensified
             human socialization and may have contributed to the emergence of language.

            Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era include clothing and shelter. 
            No consensus exists on the approximate time of adoption of either technology, but archeologists have found archeological 
            evidence of clothing 90-120 kya[18] and shelter 450 kya.[17] As the Paleolithic era progressed, dwellings became more sophisticated 
            and more elaborate; as early as 380 kya, humans were constructing temporary wood huts.[19][20] Clothing, adapted from the fur and hides
            of hunted animals, helped humanity expand into colder regions; humans began to migrate out of Africa around 200 kya,
            initially moving to Eurasia.</p>
